# Sine

Sine is an experimental Church implementation based on a clean separation of inference and evaluation.

Sine includes:

- a minimal, exact Church implementation as a Scheme library (work in progress!)
- a stochastic Scheme interpreter based on SICP that exposes control over random choices and recursive interpreter calls.

## Installation

- Add the sine directory to your <code>$VICARE_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.

## Requirements

- r6rs scheme; e.g., [vicare](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/church/wiki/Installing_Bher)
- [scheme-tools](https://github.com/stuhlmueller/scheme-tools)
